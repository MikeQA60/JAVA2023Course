        Five important facts about Java method return types:

1. A method's return type determines the type of value that the method returns to the calling code.

2. The void return type indicates that the method does not return any value.

3. The return type of a method can be any primitive data type, an object, or an array.

4. If a method has a return type other than void, it must include a return
statement that returns a value of the same type as the return type.

5. Methods with return types can be used to efficiently pass data between methods
and to return results to the calling code, which can be particularly useful in larger, more complex programs.
