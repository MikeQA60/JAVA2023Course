/*
Write a program that calculates the number of bricks needed to build a wall,
given the length and height of the wall. Assume that each brick has a size of 20cm x 10cm.
The program should print the number of bricks needed using the %d format specifier.

Given the length of the wall in centimeters: 300

and the height of the wall in centimeters: 200


How many bricks should I buy?

Expected Output:

The number of bricks needed to build the wall is: X


Where X is the number of bricks needed to build the wall.
