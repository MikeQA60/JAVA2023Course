      What are Java Format Specifier?

This tutorial covers Java Format Specifiers, which are used to print the value of a variable in a specific format.
 It will explain how to use them, when to use them, and what types of formats are supported. This tutorial will also cover some of the
 common methods used to convert values into various formats. Finally, it will provide examples of how these format specifiers can be used in
 different programming scenarios.

Java Format Specifiers are special strings used to specify how to print the value of a variable.
These format specifiers use a percent sign (%) followed by the type of data (int, float, string, etc.) and a valid formatting option.
 These format specifiers help define the output, such as width, precision, and padding characters. This allows you to convert data into
 a specific format before printing it out. For example, you can use format specifiers to print numbers with a certain width or precision,
or to print dates and times in a certain format.

The list of all Java Format Specifiers include the

%s for printing a string

%c for printing a character

%d for printing an integer

%x for printing an integer in hexadecimal format

%f for printing a floating point number

%e for printing a number in scientific notation

%t for printing a date/time field.
