/*
Recent data compiled by Reuters shows that Teslaâ€™s margins are significantly higher than those of its rivals, both in terms of gross and net profit.

Tesla Model Y's price tag starts at $41,190 The average cost of production is $31,616. What is the profit margin Tesla makes on each Model Y?

Write a program that stores the values of modelYPrice and costOfProduction in the most suitable data type.
 Then create a netProfit variable where the value is the difference between price and the cost. End the program with printing out the value of netProfit.

____ modelYPrice = ____;
____ costOfProduction = _____;
____ netProfit = ______;

System.out.println(netProfit);
