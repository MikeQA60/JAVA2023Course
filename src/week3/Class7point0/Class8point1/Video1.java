        In Java, comparison operators are used to compare two values and return
         a boolean value indicating whether the comparison is true or false. Comparison operators are
          widely used throughout every program to write business logics.

There are six comparison operators in Java:

==: equal to → this will return true only when both sides are equal, otherwise false.

!=: not equal to → this will return true only when two sides are not equal, when both sides are equal it will return false.

>: greater than → it will return true when the value on left side is more than the value on right side, otherwise returns false.

<: less than → it will return true when the value on the left side is less than the value on the right side, otherwise returns false.

>=: greater than or equal to → it will return true when the value on the right side is either greater than
or equal to the value on the right side, otherwise returns false

<=: less than or equal to → it will return true when the value on the left side is either less than or equal
 to the value on the right side, otherwise returns false.
