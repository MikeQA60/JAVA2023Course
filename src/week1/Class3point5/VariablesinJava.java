/*
Every single piece of information has a name to it. If we don't name information in our programs, it would be hard to find, send, or filter them.


In example:

10 just by itself can mean anything. It can mean October month, Messi’s number, 10 on a 1-10 scale rating, and so on.


That’s why it’s vital to label every piece of information.


Now, if we do:


byte month = 10;
byte messiNumber = 10;
byte rating = 10;



We no longer have to guess what that number 10 is.
