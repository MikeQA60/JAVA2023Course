     /*
     In English, single quotes are used less frequently than double quotes but have similar uses. Single quotes are mainly used for:

Direct speech or direct quotation, especially when the text is already enclosed in double quotes: Example: She said, "I heard him say 'I'll be back'".

To indicate irony, sarcasm, or a non-literal sense: Example: The weatherman said it would be a 'pleasant day,' but it turned out to be a blizzard.

To denote a working title, similar to double quotes: Example: I just read 'Leonardo Da Vinci' by Walter Isaacson

Note: In some English-speaking countries, single quotes are used instead of double quotes to indicate direct speech or direct quotations, while in others, the reverse is true.

Double quotes are more commonly used in the United States and the United Kingdom, while in Australia, single quotes are more commonly used. However, this can also vary across different styles and industries within these countries. For example, double quotes are more widespread in journalism and academic writing. It's always a good idea to check the specific style guide or editorial policy of a publication to determine the preferred usage of quotes.
