/*
After spending hours writing code that solves complex problems, many programmers can't run their code because of a super simple problem.
 The problem is that the programmers miss one character,
  the most frequently missed character for any programmer. We are talking about a semicolon ;

Write a program that declares a variable scaryChar with the most suitable data type and
assign a semi-colon; as a value. Then prints out the value of scaryChar;

_____ scaryChar = ____;
System.out.println(scaryChar);
 */
public class ProgrammersMostScaryCharacter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        char scaryChar = ';';
        System.out.println(scaryChar);

    }
}
