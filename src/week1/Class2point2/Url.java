/*
Here are some facts about URL (Uniform Resource Locator) structure:

A URL is a string that defines the location of a resource on the internet, such as a website or a specific file.

A URL consists of several parts: the protocol (e.g. http, https, ftp), the hostname or domain name (e.g. www.example.com), the port (e.g. 80), the path to a specific resource (e.g. /index.html), and the query string (e.g. ?q=search+terms).

Here is an example of a URL:

https://www.example.com/search?q=url+structure

In this URL:

Protocol: https

Hostname or domain name: www.example.com

Path: /search

Query string: ?q=url+structure

This URL points to the search resource on the www.example.com website and passes the url structure search term as a parameter in the query string.

Write a program that prints a URL
