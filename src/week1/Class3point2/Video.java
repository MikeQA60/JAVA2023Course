//Class 3.2 - float and double primitive data types
/*
This video lecture will dive into the floating-point data types in
Java programming language: float and double. We will discuss their size, range, precision,
and when to use them in our programs. By the end of this lecture,
you will have a solid understanding of how to use these data types effectively in your code.
