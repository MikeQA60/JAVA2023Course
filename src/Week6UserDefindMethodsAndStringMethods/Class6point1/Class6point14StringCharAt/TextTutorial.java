Common Mistakes beginners make when declaring String variables in Java

Using the == operator to compare strings: The == operator compares the references of two objects,
 rather than their contents. To compare the contents of two strings, you should use the .equals() method instead.

Forgetting to use .trim() before comparing strings: If you are comparing two strings that may have leading
 or trailing white space, you should use the .trim() method to remove the white space before comparing them.

Using the + operator to concatenate strings: The + operator can be used to concatenate strings,
 but it can be inefficient because it creates a new string object each time it is used.
 A better approach is to use a StringBuilder or StringBuffer to build up the string.

Not escaping special characters: If you want to include a special character,
 such as a newline or quotation mark, in a string literal, you must escape it using a backslash.

Not using string resources: If you need to use a string multiple times in your code,
 it is a good idea to define it as a string resource. This can make it easier to maintain your code,
 because you only need to change the string in one place.

Not using string formatting: If you need to include variable values in a string,
 it is often more readable to use string formatting rather than concatenating the variables with the string.
  The String.format() method is a useful tool for this.
